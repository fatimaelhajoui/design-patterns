## 🏗️ Implemented Patterns

### Creational Patterns

#### ✅ Singleton Pattern
The Singleton pattern ensures a class has only one instance and provides global access to it.

**Implementations:**
- **BasicSingleton** - Simple implementation (single-threaded environments only)
- **ThreadSafeSingleton** - Synchronized method approach
